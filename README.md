# README for RAG-Based Lumbar Stenosis Diagnosis System

## Overview
This Python script utilizes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model from Hugging Face's Transformers library to process texts extracted from PDF files and to perform inference. The goal is to demonstrate how a RAG model can enhance a Large Language Model's ability to generate informed responses by retrieving relevant information from a specified dataset, which in this case is derived from PDF documents related to lumbar stenosis.

## System Requirements
- Python 3.8 or newer
- PyTorch
- Transformers by Hugging Face
- Datasets library by Hugging Face
- PyPDF2

## Installation
Before running the script, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can then install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install torch transformers datasets pypdf2
```

## Files Description
- **main_script.py**: The main Python script that includes functions for reading PDFs, preprocessing data, loading the RAG model, and performing text generation.
- **document1.pdf, document2.pdf, document3.pdf**: Sample PDF files that contain text which will be processed and used by the RAG model. Ensure these are in the same directory as the script or modify the file paths in the script accordingly.

## How to Run the Script
1. **Prepare your environment**: Ensure all dependencies are installed as described above.
2. **Place your PDF files**: Make sure that your PDF files are named correctly and located in the same directory as the script. You can modify the names in the `pdf_paths` list in the script if necessary.
3. **Execute the script**: Run the script from your command line by navigating to the directory containing the script and typing:
   ```bash
   python main_script.py
   ```
4. **Observe the output**: The script will print the generated text based on a hardcoded prompt. You can change the prompt in the script to see different outputs based on the model's training and the information retrieved from the PDFs.

## What the Script Does
- **Text Extraction**: Extracts text from specified PDF documents using PyPDF2.
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Processes the extracted text to format it for use with the RAG model.
- **Model Loading**: Loads a pre-trained RAG model from Hugging Face's Transformers library.
- **Training Configuration**: Sets up training parameters (this example uses predefined parameters and does not perform actual training).
- **Inference**: The script performs an inference task where it generates text based on a sample prompt using the loaded RAG model. The RAG model utilizes the information from the processed PDF texts to inform its responses.

## Note
This script is designed for demonstration purposes and assumes the presence of three specific PDF files. For actual deployment or more robust use, further customization and extensive error handling would be necessary. Additionally, the effectiveness of the RAG model's output heavily depends on the quantity and quality of the data provided through the PDFs and the specificity of the training it has received.
